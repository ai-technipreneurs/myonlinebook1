Indeed, an alphabetical value is always a chain of characters whereas a chain of characters is not necessarily an alphabetical value. In python, a character value is always expressed between quotes(simple, double or triple) whereas a numerical value is expressed without quotes. One distinguishes two principal types of data : numerical data and data in characters. Please note that a numerical value expressed between quotes is automatically treated as a character value even if it is not an alphabetical value. It is important to keep in mind these details during the use of sequences of values in python (see example below):\n","\n","```python\n","    x = 12 # x is a numerical value\n","    y = \"12\" # y is a chain of character formed by two digits\n","    z = \"my text\" # z is a chain of character formed by alphabetical values\n","    k = \"This pen costs 5 euros\" # k is a chain of character formed by alphanumerical value\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"68h8gAj2XBlj"},"source":["For more details on chains of characters see [this page.](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def nGrams(n, s):\n","    sn=[s[i:n-1+i] for i in range(0, len(s))]\n","    return sn\n","nGrams(3, \"Good job\")\n","\n","def sim_str(s,r):\n","   l_s=nGrams(3, s)\n","   l_r=nGrams(3, r)\n","   intersection = [l for l in l_r if l in l_s]\n","   union=[l for l in l_r or l in l_s]\n","   sim=len(intersection)/len(union)\n","   return sim\n","sim_str(\"Goog job\", \"job well done\")\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n",""],"metadata":{"id":"5nIKmLZEOcpt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["file =open(\"PlagiarismTexts.txt\", 'r')\n","file.readline()\n","liste=[]\n","for line in file:  # read the file line by line\n","    l=nGrams(3, line)\n","    liste.append(l)\n","#print(liste)\n","liste[0]\n","#file.close()\n","print(len(liste))\n","\n","#for line in file: # read the file line by line\n","    #print(line)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cLDp3gh9UKbx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667073651671,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Mamadou Ramata Diallo","userId":"17320327966559515692"}},"outputId":"5db441c3-c383-4fd7-abf2-5967960265a0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["10\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"},"varInspector":{"cols":{"lenName":16,"lenType":16,"lenVar":40},"kernels_config":{"python":{"delete_cmd_postfix":"","delete_cmd_prefix":"del ","library":"var_list.py","varRefreshCmd":"print(var_dic_list())"},"r":{"delete_cmd_postfix":") ","delete_cmd_prefix":"rm(","library":"var_list.r","varRefreshCmd":"cat(var_dic_list()) "}},"types_to_exclude":["module","function","builtin_function_or_method","instance","_Feature"],"window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
